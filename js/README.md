This is the JS side of things.

I'm using [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) to build the client side library.

From this folder, simply run:

    rollup -c

This uses the default rollup config file (`rollup.config.js`) to create a single output file.

TODO: learn more about rollup (possibly use it for CSS as well)
